# Mischief.app React Native Mobile Demo

Collabarators: **Kevin Lin**

Developed this React Native app as a part of Research & Developmen(R&D) team for Mischief.app Summer Software Engineering Internship.
As a part of the R&D team, we had to determine what framework (Flutter vs React Native) would be most beneficial for Mischief to use and attempt to create a functional mobile Mischief application with the given framework, in this case React Native.

## Features
* Implemented React Native features such as **StyleSheets**, **TextInput**, **View**, **Flatlist**, **TouchableOpacity**, **useState**, and other React Native properties 
* Imported and applied third party packages in the application such as **ReactNavigation** and **Ionicons**
* Learned how to implement navigation and routes within my app with ReactNavigation attributes such **Stacks** and right/left **Drawer** tabs
* Embedded videos, images, avatar profile pictures, and other media content within the app for a more personalized experience
* Able to deploy on iOS and Android
