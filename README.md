Mischief is Hollywood's social network, offering filmmakers everything necessary to produce a feature film. 

We're building a software platform (iOS and web) to provide screenwriters, producers, cast, and crew with a social talent marketplace to find and buy scripts, hire talent, rent locations and equipment, hire post-production editors, and negotiate with distributors, including Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, and HBO.

Whether you're producing a feature film, television series, commercial, music video, web series, or student film, we aim for Mischief to fulfill all of your entertainment needs.
